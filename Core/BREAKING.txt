V5 URL API
* The following commands are supported: `mode`, `anchor`, `flip`, `sflip`,
    `quality`, `zoom`, `dpr`, `crop`, `cropxunits`, `cropyunits`,
    `w`, `h`, `width`, `height`, `maxwidth`, `maxheight`, `format`,
    `srotate`, `rotate`, `stretch`, `webp.lossless`, `webp.quality`,
    `f.sharpen`, `f.sharpen_when`, `down.colorspace`, `bgcolor`, 
    `jpeg_idct_downscale_linear`, `watermark`, `s.invert`, `s.sepia`, 
    `s.grayscale`, `s.alpha`, `s.brightness`, `s.contrast`, `s.saturation`, 
    `trim.threshold`, `trim.percentpadding`, `a.balancewhite`,  `jpeg.progressive`,
    `decoder.min_precise_scaling_ratio`, `scale`, `preset`, `s.roundcorners`, 'ignoreicc'
    
* With the Imageflow backend, images are always auto-rotated based on Exif information, so `autorotate` is ignored. 
This is a breaking change from ImageResizer 4.x where images are not autorotated by default.
* Images can only be rotated in 90 degree intervals, so `rotate` is partially supported.
* TIFF files are not supported in Imageflow, so `page=x` is not supported.
* Animated GIFs are fully supported in Imageflow, so `frame=x` is not useful/ignored.

* Adding arbitrary margins, padding, and borders to images is obsolete, so 
    `paddingwidth`, `paddingheight`, `margin`
    `borderwidth`, `bordercolor` and `paddingcolor` are now ignored. 
    
* Caching, processing, and encoders/builders/decoders are not configurable via the querystring,
    so `cache`, `process`, `encoder`, `decoder`, and `builder` are ignored.
 * Sharpening is now done with `f.sharpen`, not `a.sharpen`, and `a.sharpen` is ignored.
 * Noise removal is not yet supported, so `a.removenoise` is ignored.
 * Blurring is not yet supported, so `a.blur` is ignored.
 * 404 redirects are not implemented, so `404` is ignored.
 
Things you would expect to be gone:

* Gradient plugin is gone, along with &color1,color2, angle commands
* DropShadow plugin and assocated &shadow* commands
* Some plugins have been deprecated for a decade and their commands are gone, such as &speed from SpeedOrQuality
* Undocumented commands like preservePalette are gone
* PrettyGifs is gone (Imageflow does 1000x better), along with &dither, &colors, and &preservePalette
* FreeImage is gone (it is rarely updated and a big security risk), along with &fi.scale
* AdvancedFilters is gone (most features were infrequently used, and Imageflow has sharpening (f.sharpen) and 
  auto white balance now). This removed a.oilpainting, a.sobel,  a.threshold, a.canny, a.equalize, a.posterize. You can still use `a.balancewhite`  
* &memcache is gone, it's not a great idea in the first place and never exited pre-alpha
* With Imageflow, Jpeg subsampling is auto-selected by chroma evaluation, so `subsampling` is ignored (it's also not supported in GDI)





TODO: expose jpeg.progressive in Instructions class- Supported by Imageflow, but not GDI, WIC, or WPF
TODO: maybe implement `dpi` - This feature is only useful if the user downloads the image before printing it. Lots of confusion around DPI, need to find a way to make it obvious. Perhaps naming it PrintDPI?
 
 
V5 C# API:

REVISIT: private readonly string[] _supportedFileExtensions = new string[]
            { "bmp", "gif", "exif", "png", "tif", "tiff", "tff", "jpg", "jpeg", "jpe", "jif", "jfif", "jfi" };



Many classes and interfaces have moved to the Imazen.Common nuget package - add that to your project and a good 
IDE can probably automatically find the new namespaces.
