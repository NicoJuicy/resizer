ADVISORY

Please note that CSS, javascript, binaries, and dependencies used by these test projects may be provided by their respective publishers under different licenses. It is your responsibility to locate and comply with the respective license terms for each dependency.

Many ImageResizer plugins used in the tests are ONLY available under the AGPL or a commercial license, NOT the Apache license. You may need to either purchase a license or comply with the terms of the AGPL to use some plugins. 

Worded differently, only the test code is Apache licensed - the software it tests may or may not be. 

See /LICENSE.md for alternate license options and information about files outside this directory.
