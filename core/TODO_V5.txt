## Todo for V5

* Create example projects and getting started tutorials
* Update /resizer.debug to guide removal of old plugins and migration to new
* Create migration guide in readme
* Create watermark system.

* Create HybridCache plugin



IResponseArgs ?



* Make old CommitAttribute crash with informative message that V4 plugins need to be removed.


TODO: expose jpeg.progressive in Instructions class- Supported by Imageflow, but not GDI, WIC, or WPF
TODO: maybe implement `dpi` - This feature is only useful if the user downloads the image before printing it. Lots of confusion around DPI, need to find a way to make it obvious. Perhaps naming it PrintDPI?
 


V5 C# API:

REVISIT: private readonly string[] _supportedFileExtensions = new string[]
            { "bmp", "gif", "exif", "png", "tif", "tiff", "tff", "jpg", "jpeg", "jpe", "jif", "jfif", "jfi" };


LATER

* Create migration guide

* Unify storage providers and add support for proxying static non-image files
* Add support for caching source blobs under certain circumstances
* Auto-select builder based on unsupported command keys (and maybe watermarks)
* Obsolete ResizeSettings members that Imageflow doesn't support
* Figure out AWS credential delay
* Address weakness in letting cache=no and process=no happen from querystring; 

* Figure out graceful shutdown for HybridCache (Dispose on httpmodule?)

* Implement watermark config translation

* Integrate licensing from Imazen.Common and migrate just the enforcer tests

* Write script to update package description and status for everything that is deprecated

* We need to add build edition metadata for licensing  [assembly: ImageResizer.Util.Edition("R4Performance")]

* And maybe GUID for COM? Check V4 API texts for old values [assembly: System.Runtime.InteropServices.Guid("8edaeb47-7067-4c77-aa1b-ffbeeab5e81d")]

IN V6:

* Add direct support for Imazen.Common.Storage.IBlobProvider
* Fix response headers system under async
* Unify RemoteReader and encrypted/signed URL system.
* Unify SizeLimiting and JobSecurity
